    Hello! If you're reading this, you are probably trying to re-enable pastebin.
    Fair enough, if you're trying to write your own script locally it would be nice to be able to upload it.

    It's not too difficult, although it does require a bit of basic knowledge of either Lua and/or hosting files.
    
    Once you've succeeded, please make sure not to just steal people's scripts or I'll be forced to disable http access in general.
    Some hints to restoring the ability to download files: 
    * Access to github.com and pastebin.com are blocked. 
    * Computercraft is open source and there's an emulator for it.
    * There are more places to host files than github and pastebin.
    * Access blocking uses 
    * If you want to make your own version of the pastebin program: https://tweaked.cc/module/http.html
